		Welcome! This is mnnit chess club's official website. You can play against your friends or
		participate in weekly arenas. We will decorate the home page better soon!
	</p>
	<p>
		In the mean time, you can take a look at some of these:
		<a class="text-blue-700" href="https://github.com/theAnuragMishra/mnnit-chess-club"
			>source code</a
		>,
		<a class="text-blue-700" href="/dev">a high level design of the server</a>.
	</p>
	<div class="flex w-full flex-col gap-2">
		<p>Or you can:</p>
		{#if !user.id}
			<a href="/login" class="w-fit text-xl text-blue-500">Login to play</a>
		{:else}
			<a href="/play" class="w-fit cursor-pointer rounded-lg bg-gray-500 p-3 text-4xl"> Play! </a>
		{/if}
		<p>
			Heads up: matchmaking may not be instant because we don't have users always trying to match on
			the site. You can create and share challenge links to your friends though!

			If you're wondering why you've been logged out and have to create a username again, umm
			actually I nuked the database because of schema changes.
		</p>
		<p>
			I did this because the site is still only in "preview" and not publicly launched and
			recreating the tables is much smoother than running alter table queries. Once the site is
			launched for everyone though, I will not have the freedom to delete the database and recreate
			because who would want their games lost ü§∑üèª
